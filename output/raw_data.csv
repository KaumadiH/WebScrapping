 get in touch for using w3schools plus and certifications as an educational institution html is the standard markup language for creating web pages. an html element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: the html element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: note: some html elements have no content (like the <br> 
element). these elements are called empty elements. empty elements do not have an end tag! the purpose of a web browser (chrome, edge, firefox, safari) is to read html documents and display them 
correctly. a browser does not display the html tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:  below is a visualization of an html page structure: note: the content inside the <body> section 
will be displayed in a browser. the content inside the <title> element will be 
shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. since the early days of the world wide web, there have been many versions of html: this tutorial follows the latest html5 standard. if you want to use w3schools services as an educational institution, team or enterprise, send us an e-mail:sales@w3schools.com if you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, send us an e-mail:help@w3schools.com"

 get in touch for using w3schools plus and certifications as an educational institution a simple text editor is all you need to learn html. web pages can be created and modified by using professional html editors. however, for learning html we recommend a simple text editor like notepad (pc) or textedit (mac). we believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn html. follow the steps below to create your first web page with notepad or textedit. windows 8 or later: open the start screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). type notepad. windows 7 or earlier: open start > 
programs > accessories > notepad open finder > applications > textedit also change some preferences to get the application to 
save files correctly.

choose ""plain text"" then under ""open and save"", check the box that says ""display html files as html code instead of formatted text"". then open a new document to place the code. write or copy the following html code into notepad:  save the file on your computer. select file > save as in the notepad menu. name the file ""index.htm"" and set the encoding to 
utf-8 (which is the preferred encoding for html files).  tip: you can use either .htm or .html as file extension. there is no difference; it is up to you. open the saved html file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, 
or right-click - and choose ""open with""). the result will look much like this:  with our free online editor, you can edit the html code and view the result in your browser. it is the perfect tool when you want to test code fast. it also has color

 get in touch for using w3schools plus and certifications as an educational institution in this chapter we will show some basic html examples. don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet. all html documents must start with a document type declaration: <!doctype html>. the html document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>. the visible part of the html document is between <body> and </body>.  the <!doctype> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. it must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any html tags).  the <!doctype> declaration is not case sensitive. the <!doctype> declaration for html5 is: html headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important 
heading:  html paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: html links are defined with the <a> tag: the link's destination is specified in the href attribute.  attributes are used to provide additional information about html elements. you will learn more about attributes in a later chapter. html images are defined with the <img> tag. the source file (src), alternative text (alt), 
width, and height are provided as attributes: have you ever seen a web page and wondered ""hey! how did they do that?"" click ctrl + u in an html page, or right-click on the page and select ""view page source"". this will open a 
new tab 
containing the html source code of the page. right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose ""inspect"" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both 
the html and the css). you can also edit the html or css on-the-fly in the 
elements or styles panel that opens. html elements are surrounded by a specific type of brackets, which one? start the exercise if you want to use w3schools services as an educational institution, team or enterprise, send us an e-mail:sales@w3schools.com if you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, send us an e-mail:help@w3schools.com"

 get in touch for using w3schools plus and certifications as an educational institution an html element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an 
end tag. the html element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: examples of some html elements: note: some html elements have no content (like the <br> 
element). these elements are called empty elements. empty elements do not have an end tag! html elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements). all html documents consist of nested html elements. the following example contains four html elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> 
and <p>): the <html> element is the root element 
and it defines the whole html document. it has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>. then, inside the <html> element there is 
a <body> 
element: the <body> element defines the 
document's body. it has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>. then, inside the <body> element there 
are two other elements:
<h1> and 
<p>: the <h1> element defines a heading. it has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>: the <p> element defines a paragraph. it has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>: some html elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag: however, never rely on this! unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag! html elements with no content are called empty elements. the <br> tag defines a line break, and 
is an empty element without a closing tag: html tags are not case sensitive: <p> means the same as <p>. the html standard does not require lowercase tags, but w3c
recommends lowercase in html, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like xhtml. at w3schools we always use lowercase tag names. insert the correct end tag for the html heading. start the exercise w3schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes. for a complete list of all available html tags, visit our html tag reference. if you want to use w3schools services as an educational institution, team or enterprise, send us an e-mail:sales@w3schools.com if you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, send us an e-mail:help@w3schools.com"

 get in touch for using w3schools plus and certifications as an educational institution html contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning. this text is bold this text is italic this is subscript and superscript formatting elements were designed to display special types of text: the html <b> element defines bold text, 
without any extra importance. the html <strong> element defines text 
with strong importance. the content inside is typically displayed in bold. the html <i> element defines a part of 
text in an alternate voice or mood. the content inside is typically displayed in 
italic. tip: the <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, 
a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc. the html <em> element defines 
emphasized text. the content inside is typically displayed in italic. tip: a screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> 
with an emphasis, using verbal stress. the html <small> element defines 
smaller text: the html <mark> element defines text 
that should be marked or highlighted: the html <del> element defines text 
that has been deleted from a document. browsers will usually strike a line 
through deleted text: the html <ins> element defines a text 
that has been inserted into a document. browsers will usually underline inserted 
text: the html <sub> element defines 
subscript text. subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, 
and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. subscript text can be used for 
chemical formulas, like h2o: the html <sup> element defines 
superscript text. superscript text appears half a character above the normal 
line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. superscript text can be used 
for footnotes, like www[1]: add extra importance to the word ""degradation"" in the paragraph below. start the exercise for a complete list of all available html tags, visit our html tag reference. if you want to use w3schools services as an educational institution, team or enterprise, send us an e-mail:sales@w3schools.com if you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, send us an e-mail:help@w3schools.com"

 get in touch for using w3schools plus and certifications as an educational institution in this chapter we will go through the 
<blockquote>,<q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, 
and <bdo> html elements. here is a quote from wwf's website: the html <blockquote> element defines a section that 
is quoted from another source. browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements. the html <q> tag defines a short quotation. browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation. the html <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like ""html"", 
""css"", ""mr."", 
""dr."", ""asap"", ""atm"". marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation 
systems and search-engines. tip: use the global title attribute to 
show the description for the 
abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.  the html <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document 
or an article. the contact information can be an email address, url, physical address, phone 
number, social media handle, etc. the text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, 
and browsers will
always add a line break before and after the <address> element. the html <cite> tag defines the title of a 
creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.). note: a person's name is not the title of a work. the text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic. bdo stands for bi-directional override. the html <bdo> tag is used to override 
the current text direction: use an html element to add quotation marks around the letters ""cool"". start the exercise for a complete list of all available html tags, visit our html tag reference. if you want to use w3schools services as an educational institution, team or enterprise, send us an e-mail:sales@w3schools.com if you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, send us an e-mail:help@w3schools.com"
